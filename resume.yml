summary:
  short:
    -
      >
        I am a human turned software engineer who toils by day and codes by night. I like
        doing things with CSharp, C++, Python, Ruby, Javascript, and pretty much any other technology
        I can get my hands on. I even make my hands dirty with C on microcontrollers,
        to build funny and interesting things. I love to solve problems with the latest trends and technologies.
    -
      >
        During my spare time I love to work on my side projects and to improve my ZSH, VI and Linux skills.
        If I don't do some programming, I read Hackernews, Stackoverflow and code on Github.
    -
      >
        At the moment I discover the wonderful world of web development with the latest technologies
        (HTML5, Javascript, Sinatra, Flask, Websockets, WebGL). Furthermore, I deepen my knowledge with
        micrcontrollers and C.

        At the age of 14 I wrote my first lines of code in Basic on a 80286 PC. From that time
        on I was hooked to everything that was related to computers. Some years later, I
        studied (2001 - 2005) at the University of Applied Sciences Augsburg and graduated in
        Computer Science. During my first year at the University I was introduced to the Open
        Source community. For internship I worked at IBM where I extended the crash dump system
        of the Linux Kernel. I wrote my diploma thesis about the detection and preventation of covert
        communication channels at Astaro AG.

        In the year 2004, my friend and I realized together my first Open Source program: XMMS Weasel.
        Since that time I'm passionate about the Open Source community and I enjoy to contribute during
        my spare time.

        At the beginning of 2006 I joined 3M|GTG where I architected and developed software for
        Digital Signage applications. I gained considerable experience in CSharp, PLC, Python development
        and network programming during building exciting Digital Signage systems. Especially I love
        to develop software for connecting the real world (e.g. mechanical systems) to the software world.
        Moreover, I have extensive experience in leadership in technology including design and development
        of applications, team management, developer mentoring, problem solving and crisis mangement.
