summary:
  -
    >
      I am a human turned software engineer who toils by day and codes by night. I like
      doing things with CSharp, C++, Python, Ruby, Javascript, and pretty much any other technology
      I can get my hands on. Sometimes I even make my hands dirty with C on microcontrollers,
      to build funny things. I love to solve problems with the latest trends and technologies.

      At the age of 14 I wrote my first lines of code in Basic on a 80286 PC. From that time
      on I was hooked to everything that was related to computers. Some years later, I
      studied (2001 - 2005) at the University of Applied Sciences Augsburg and graduated in
      Computer Science. During my first year at the University I was introduced to the Open
      Source community. For internship I worked at IBM where I extended the crash dump system
      of the Linux Kernel. I wrote my diploma thesis about the detection and preventation of covert
      communication channels at Astaro AG.

      In the year 2004, my friend and I realized together my first Open Source program: XMMS Weasel.
      Since that time I'm passionate about the Open Source community and I enjoy to contribute during
      my spare time.

      At the beginning of 2006 I joined 3M|GTG where I architected and developed software for
      Digital Signage applications. I gained considerable experience in CSharp, PLC, Python development
      and network programming during building exciting Digital Signage systems. Especially I love
      to develop software for connecting the real world (e.g. mechanical systems) to the software world.
      Moreover, I have extensive experience in leadership in technology including design and development
      of applications, team management, developer mentoring, problem solving and crisis mangement.

      During my spare time I love to work on my projects, to improve my ZSH, VI and Linux skills.
      If I don't do some programming, I read Hackernews, Stackoverflow and read some code on Github.

      At the moment I discover the wonderful world of web development with the latest technologies
      (HTML5, Javascript, Sinatra, Flask, Websockets, WebGL).
