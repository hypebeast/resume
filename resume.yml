  short:
    -
      >
        I am a human turned software engineer who toils by day and codes by night. I like
        doing things with NodeJS, Go, Python, Ruby, CSharp, and pretty much any other technology
        I can get my hands on. I even make my hands dirty with C on microcontrollers,
        to build funny and interesting things. I love to solve problems with the latest trends and technologies.
        Furthermore, I enjoy to build and develop great projects and applications with motivated and dedicative people.
    -
      >
        During my spare time I love to work on my side projects and to improve my ZSH, VI and Linux skills.
        If I don't do some programming, I read Hackernews, Stackoverflow and code on Github.

        At the moment I am proud to realize and develop great projects with the wonderful people at Netlight.

        At the age of 14 I wrote my first lines of code in Basic on a 80286 PC. From that time
        on I was hooked to everything that was related to computers. Some years later, I
        studied (2001 - 2005) at the University of Applied Sciences Augsburg and graduated in
        Computer Science. During my first year at the University I was introduced to the Open
        Source community. For internship I worked at IBM where I extended the crash dump system
        of the Linux Kernel. I wrote my diploma thesis about the detection and preventation of covert
        communication channels at Astaro AG.

      >
        In the year 2004, I realized my first Open Source program: XMMS Weasel.
        Since that time I am passionate about the Open Source community and I enjoy to contribute during
        my spare time.

        At the beginning of 2006 I joined 3M|GTG where I architected and developed software for
        Digital Signage applications. I gained considerable experience in CSharp, PLC, Python development
        and network programming during building exciting Digital Signage systems. Especially I love
        to develop software for connecting the real world (e.g. mechanical systems) to the software world.
        Moreover, I have extensive experience in leadership in technology including design and development
        of applications, team management, developer mentoring, problem solving and crisis mangement.

        Since 2014 I work at Netlight where I'm able to have a great time with wonderful and smart colleagues.
        During my work at Netlight I'm gained much experience architecturing and developing big scale web services that
        are used by many people all over the world.
