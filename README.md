# Resume

My personal resume.

## Overview

My personal resume build with Ruby and ERB. The content is stored in a YAML file and uses ERB to build different output files. Currently Latex and HTML are supported output formats.

The HTML version is based on the Spacelab theme from Bootswatch (http://bootswatch.com).

Rubber (https://launchpad.net/rubber/) is used to build a PDF from the Latex source.

## Instructions

TODO: How to build everything.

## Used technologies (for the geeks)

The following tools are used to build the resume:

* Rake: For compilation
* YAML: Stores the content
* ERB: Used for templating
* Twitter Bootstrap: CSS for the the HTML output
* Rubber: Used to generate a PDF file from the Latex source
* Vim and Git: ...

The idea was to avoid data duplication and to seperate content from presentation.

This project was inspired by:

* TODO
